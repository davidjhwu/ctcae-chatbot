#### NOT FOR CLINICAL USE
This is a simple proof-of-concept chatbot for symptom gathering and classification acc. to CTCAE guidelines.

To run this locally, you will need to have access to GPT-4 and set your OpenAI API key as a local variable in the 'env' file or as a variable in main.py as 'OPENAI_API_KEY'.

If you do not have access to GPT-4, you will have to go into 'main.py' and change 'model' from 'gpt-4' to 'gpt-3.5-turbo'

After you launch, visit the 'Public' or 'Local' URL to demo the chatbot
